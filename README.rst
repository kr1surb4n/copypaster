Copypaster - a copy/paste tool that aims to change your
work into simple copy-pasting by making visual snippets list. I want to code like I play Starcraft - by choosing
what to build from a list and not check in documentation
all the time, before I remember.


It creates rows of buttons, which when pressed, write
to your clipboard some value that you stored earlier.

Inspired by my private method of coding - copy/pasting.
Where most of my code is copied from other parts of the software I'm working on. Not remember all the functions, but choose from a list and have no worries if I typed anything wrong.

Also, working in a corporate environment tool like clipboard manager proved itself usefull - you have a lot
of problems daily that require the same message.
