** <2019-09-13 piÄ…>
today i started to think about the way
i should start this project

i need to start from the test.
but to how i should start?

skeleton is hanging all the meat.
lets build a skeleton of the app
and then we see.

i will build all the components
in a static state. this will
also include all possible states.

** <2019-09-14 sob>
the skeleton was build
but aligning all objects inside a frame
is complicated

i will try now to use gtk3 with pygobjects

** <2019-09-15 nie>

im reading the gtk manual but i have to write stuff up
and see where this will take me


also i need to run the git inside here

there where apps written in python in gtk3.
where are they and why i dont have them on my hard drive?
